== About

This is the builder for my https://nirokay.com[webpage].

== Structure

This module is separate from the https://github.com/nirokay/nirokay.com[actual website repository] and requires it to be in the root directory of this repo (or be linked to it).

```sh
.
├── nirokay.com/ -> /home/niro/Git/nirokay.com
│   └── ...
├── resources/
│   └── ...
├── src/
│   └── ...
├── webpage_builder.nimble
└── ...
```

This allows `deploy.sh` to add, commit and push the changes automatically.

Very important!
